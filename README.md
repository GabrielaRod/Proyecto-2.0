This is a Website developed to manage, edit, delete and track assets registered by the users using the AssetTracker android application. The purpose of this site is mainly to give the authorities information regarding an asset being reported as stolen that has been visible by the multiple tracking points scattered across the city in each important interception. 

This site was developed by Gabriela Rodriguez as part of her final project to graduate college from the Telematic Engineering career.
